# Pytaya

The Red Pitaya is a FPGA dev board which provides an SCPI interface and all sorts of ways to customize it. But why not just use the existing applications and their WebSocket interfaces? Then most of the difficult work is done if you want to build your own user interface? So that's what I'm doing, despite the total lack of documentation.
